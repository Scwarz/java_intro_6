How to convert an ArrayList to an Array?
-we use toArray() method
-this method always return an Object[] 


ConcurrentModificationException
-You will get this Exception when you try removing elements with a loop.
-Runtime is not allowing you to modify the size of the collection while you loop it.




Assume that you are give some numbers, and asked to return uniques


Object[] getUniques(List<Integer> numbers){
	ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();

	//find all the uniques

	return list.toArray();
}




Removing all the elements that has R or r
Return the ones that does not have R or r


Remove all the elements that has vowels 
Keep all the the elements that does not have any vowel




Iterator
3, 0, 30


hasNext() 	-> checking if there is element left in the list
next() 		-> getting the next element
remove() 	-> removes the elements that is received
