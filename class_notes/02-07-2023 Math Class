Math Class is a class that allows us to do different math examples in our program

Methods:
1. max():
	- Syntax: Math.max(int x, int y);
	- Finds the max of the given numbers
	- max() takes 2 aruguments as int and returns one single int

2. min():
	- Syntax: Math.min(int x, int y);
	- Finds the min of the given numbers
	- min() takes 2 aruguments as int and returns one single int

3. abs():
	- Syntax: Math.abs(int/double x);
	- Takes 1 int as a argument and returns the 1 int as a positive number

4. sqrt():
	- Syntax: Math.sqrt(double d);
	- sqrt() is a method that takes a double as an argument and returns that numbers with its square root.

5. round():
	-Syntax: Math.round(double d);
	-round() is a method that takes a double as an argument and retruns that number rounded
	- 25.6 -> 26
	- 5.4  -> 5
6. random()
	- Syntax: Math.random();
	- random does not take any arguments
	- random() is a method to generate random numebrs for 0.0 to 1.0 where 1 is not included
	- we can add or multiply to this number to change the range
