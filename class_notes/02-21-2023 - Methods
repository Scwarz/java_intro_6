Method: it is a block of code that runs a task when invoked.
-Method is also known as function
-Every method has a task and usually that task is the given as a name as well.
-method is always shown with ()


CREATING CUSTOM METHODS
-task
-name
-return or void
-static or non-static
-accessibility level


public void printHi(){
	System.out.println("Hi");
}




EXAMPLES:
main() -> special method that tells JVM where the execution point is.
You cannot execute any program without main method in Java unless you implement a third-party tool


2 TYPES OF METHOD
1. return types: it returns something
They return a result back which can be stored in a variable.
	Math.random(), Math.min(), Math.max(), Math.abs(), Math.sqrt()
	Scanner methods: nextInt(), next(), nextLine()
	Random methods: nextInt(), nextDouble()


2. void types: does not return anything
These methods are created with keyword <void>
	System methods: print(), println()

	System.out.println("Hello world");




2 TYPES OF METHODS
1. static: These are the methods can be invoked (called) with the class name.
These methods does not require you to create an object.

SYNTAX:
ClassName.methodName()
Math.min()
Math.max()
Integer.parseInt()
System.out.print()


2. non-static: These methods can only be invoked with objects.
To be able to call them, we need to create an object of the class first.

Scanner methods

Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
input.nextInt();

Here, input is a Scanner Object variable
And we invoke nextInt() method with the object


Random methods
Random r = new Random();
r.nextInt()
r.nextInt(25)


WE CAN CREATE OUR OWN CUSTOM METHODS
-We can make them either void or return type
-We can make them either static or non-static


void methods can be either static or non-static
return methods can be either static or non-static

static methods can either be void or return
non-static methods can either be void or return




enterAnAge(), enterAFirstName(), enterALastName(), enterANumber(), enterAnAddress(), enterAFullname()


NOTE: unreachable code
Any code under the return statement cannot be executed by JVM and will be a compiler error.


METHOD ARGUMENTS - PARAMETERS
-methods can take some arguments and manipulate them inside the block


public static int max(int a, int b) {
    if(a > b) {
    	return a;
    }
    else {
    	return b;
    }
}

Math.max()



METHOD SIGNATURE = method name + arguments
accessModifier, other modifiers and return or void is not part of the method signature
