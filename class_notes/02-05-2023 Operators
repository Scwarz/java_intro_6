Operators: Symbols used for math, logical, comparison, relational, assignment

Assignment operator:
=
dataType variableName = value;


Arithmetic:
+ - / * %


+ operator used for concatenation and addition

String + String -> concatenation
number + number -> addition
String  + number -> concatenation
String + number + number -> concatenation
String + (number + number) -> addition, concatenation
number + number + String -> addition, concatenation



Shorthand Assignment operator:
+= 
-=
/=
*=
%=

int number = 45;

//number = number + 10;
number += 10;

System.out.println(number);



1. Assignment operator
2. Arithmetic operators
3. Shorthand assignment operator

4. Increment and decrement operators

int number = 10;

number++; // post increment
++number; // pre increment

number--; // post decrement
--number; // pre decrement

NOTE: We will mostly be using post increment and post decrement
number++; 
number--;


++ increases the variable by one.
-- decreases the variable by one.


5. Relational operators
Relational operators are used to compare 2 expressions and returns a boolean

Relational operators always return either true or false

< 	is used for less than
<= 	is used for less than or equals
> 	is used for greater than
>= 	is used for greater than or equals
== 	comparison -> checks if both sides are equal
!= 	comparison (not equal) -> checks if both sides are not equal


3 < 5 		-> true
10 >= 3 	-> true

5 == 5 		-> true
3 != 5 		-> true

10 != 10 	-> false


3 + 5 == 2 * 4 	-> true
8 == 8 			-> true


5 > 10 	-> false
3 >= 2 	-> true



NOT OPERATOR (!)


6. Logical operators
Logical operators are used to check multiple conditions and they return a boolean
There are 2 types of logical operators used in Java

	1. AND operator &
	2. OR operator |

With or statements, if one expression is true, then whole expression is true
With and statements, if one expression is false, then whole expression is false

Today is Sunday or Monday 		-> true
Today is Sunday and Monday 		-> false

Today is Sunday and we have online class -> true
Today is Sunday and we do not have class -> false


I am wearing white or blue t-shirt -> true
Today is Sunday or Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday -> true


2 < 5 && 5 != 5 		-> false

7 < 7 || true 	-> true

5 != 7 && 3 == 3 	-> 
true && true 		-> true


(5 != 5 || 10 <= 10) && false 	-> false


2 < 1 || 5 > 10 	-> false


true && (true) && false 	-> false



20 / 4 != 5 || 2 * 5 == 40 / 4 	->
5 != 5 || 10 == 10
false || true
true





true | false | false | true	  		-> true
true || false || false || true 		-> true


true || false || true 	-> true


NOTE: WE ALWAYS USE || or &&


3 > 5 && (______________________________) -> false



2 * 5 == (20 / 4) * 2 > 10 || true 	-> error

10 == 10 > 10 || true

true > 10 || true



2 == 2 && (false != true) 	-> true





!true 		-> false
!false 		-> true


(true || 5 < 3) && !(5 == 5 && 2 < 0) 	-> true


!(((5 * 20 == 50) && !true) || !(5 > 10 || false || !true))

!(false || true)

false
