Arrays: 
+it is a collection used to store multiple data
+It allows us to manipulate the date inside it
+Allows duplicates
+it can used both with primitives and reference types

-fixed-sized, and you cannot add/remove elements


NOTE: Only arrays can work with primitives while all other collections works only with reference types

Arrays vs ArrayList
-ArrayList can be considered as dynamic sized arrays
-both of them collections and used to store multiple similar data.
-both allows null elements.
-both allows duplicates.
-Arrays are fixed-sized while we can modify ArrayLists by adding or removing elements.
-Arrays can store both primitives and object while ArrayList can only store objects.
-Arrays does not provide many useful methods to update, retrieve elements (instead we use [index]). On the other hand, ArrayList provides many useful methods to get, delete, update, add, etc elements.


ARRAYLIST METHODS
-Individual element manipulation
-Group of element manipulation
	addAll(), removeAll(), containsAll(), retainAll()

list contains "Jane", "Jasmine", "John"


ARRAYLIST SNYTAX:
ArrayList<dataType> varName = new ArrayList<>();
List<dataType> varName = new ArrayList<>();


JAVA COLLECTION FRAMEWORK

byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean
Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double, Character, Boolean



String name = "John";

name.indexOf('x'); // -1



list -> 10, 15, 13, 26, 11, 6, 7, 3, 5, 13, 26, 3
removeList -> 3, 13, 26


Remove all the elements that are equals 3, 13, 26


list.removeAll(removeList)



Keep the elements that 15, 5, and 7 but remove the rest
