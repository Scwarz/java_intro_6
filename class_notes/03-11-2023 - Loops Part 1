Loops: executing a block of code repeatedly - many times
-it has a condition part
-it has a termination (stop) point
-saves redundant lines of code and make your reusable

iteration: this is each execution of the block in a loop
It is how many times your loop executes

infinite loop: this is a loop that never meets the termination point and never stops. 


1. For loop (i loop) - traditional loop
SYNTAX:
