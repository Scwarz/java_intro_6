RECAP:

Naming convention:
Class name: 
	-Meaningful
	-Starts with uppercase
	-Follows camelcase rule
	-It cannot start with digits and specials except _, $ the other currencies
	-It cannot have space

Package name:
	-Meaningful
	-Starts with lowercase
	-Follows camelcase rule
	-It cannot start with digits and specials except
	-It cannot have space (my_package)

public class MyClass{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		// all our code goes here
	}
}


Variable: containers that stores data.
dataType variableName = value;

int age = 25;
String name = "John";

In the above statements, age and name are variables used to store data.


Primitives:
byte, short, int, long 	-> absolute numbers like 2, 10, 35
float, double	 		-> decimal numbers like 2, 10.65, 
char 					-> single character like 'A', '$'
boolean 				-> true or false



int age = 25;
double price = 25;
char var1 = 'e';
boolean b1 = true;
boolean b2 = false;


String var2 = "text";


NOTE: Store all the currency related data in double.

String age = "25";



Scanner: 	
-It is a Java class that helps reading input from user.
-It comes from java.util package
-It has some pre-defined methods for reading different types of data.

next() 		-> reads only one String data from the user
nextLine() 	-> reads the whole line as a String from the user
nextInt() 	-> reads the next absolute number data from the user
nextDouble()-> reads the next decimal number data from the user


HOW TO USE Scanner Object?
1. Create a Scanner object
	Scanner varName = new Scanner(System.in);

	input, myScanner, scanner, scan, inputReader

2. Make sure it is imported from java.util package
3. Use variable name to read data from the user


Redundant: extra code in your program that can be eliminated.


NICE CODE:
Readable: 
	-providing space for the operators
	-meaningful identifiers (variable, class, package, object)

Reusable: reuse your object and variables if possible

Comments: single line, multiline, documentation

Scanner problem for skipping some questions!!!

next(), nextInt(), nextDouble()... 

empty line -> nextLine()

nextLine()




OPERATORS
1. Assignment Operator
	= operator is used to assign values into variables

	int age = 45; // data = number
	String name = "John"; //  data = text
	Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); // data = scanner object

2. Arithmetic operators
Java has 5 basic arithmetic operators
	+ 	addition
	- 	subtraction
	* 	multiplication
	/ 	division
	% 	modulus (remainder)


REMAINDER
First number is greater than the second and first number and is not divisible by the second?

10 % 4 = 2 		-> 10 = 2*4 + 2
35 % 8 = 3 		-> 35 = 4*8 + 3

23 % 9 = 5		-> 23 = 2*9 + 5

63 % 8 = 7		-> 63 = 7*8 + 7


First number is greater than or equals the second and first number and is divisible by the second number?

4 % 2 = 0 		-> 4 = 2*2 + 0
5 % 5 = 0
35 % 7 = 0




First number is less than the second
3 % 5 	= 3 	-> 3 = 0*5 + 3
27 % 30 = 27 	-> 27 = 0*30 + 27
7 % 10 = 7


23 % 3 = 2
7 % 15 = 7
10 % 10 = 0
35 % 5 = 0


NOTE: BE CAREFUL with + operator
+ is used for concatenation
+ is used for addition

num + num + num -> addition
"" + num + num 	-> concatenation

"The sum = 105"


JAVA EXECUTION ORDER
Top to bottom
Left to right





Order of operations
1. Exponential
2. Parentheses
3. Multiplication/division
4. Sum/subtraction



3 + 5 - 2 * 3 = 

(3 * (2 + 5 - 3)) / 2 = 6

2^3 + 5 / 5 * 3 + 3 - 2 = 12





Shorthand Assignment operators
+=   
-=
/=
*=
%=



double balance = 100.0;

balance -= 4.53; // 95.47

balance -= 25.27; // 70.2

balance += 150.0; // 220.2
