Loops
	-


1. for loop - i loop - traditional loop
2. while loop
3. do-while loop
4. for each loop - used with collections



INFINITE LOOP: this is the loop you have a mistake and never stops.
The update is not going towards the termination condition

for(initialization; termination; update){
	
}

for(int i = 10; i < 20; i--){ // infinite loop
	
}

for(; ;){ // infinite loop
	
}


OCA EXAM: JAVA Certification



A LOOP THAT NEVER RUN:
-When the condition is false for the first iteration, then the loop does not run.

for(int i = 10; i > 20; i++){
	System.out.println(i);
}



iteration: each time that loop executes





while loop syntax:
-initialization, termination, update

initialization

while(condition){
	//block of code to be executed
	update
}


int num = 1;

while(num <= 5){
	sout(num);
	num++;
}



String name = "Okan"; // nakO James

name.charAt(3) + name.charAt(2) + name.charAt(1) + name.charAt(0)
n 				 a 				  k 			   O


3,2,1,0

String str = "";

for(int i = name.length()-1; i >= 0; i--){
	str += name.charAt(i);
}

return str;


-last char to first char
-length times execution

for(int i = name.length()-1; i >= 0; i--){
	System.out.println(name.charAt(i));
}



do-while loop syntax:

do{
	//a block code of to execute
}
while(condition);

run the block of the code while the condition is true;

NOTE: do-while loop will always execute at least once

the do while loop can be usedÂ in all scenarios where the loop body needs to be executed at least once.


Write a program that asks user to enter a positive number,
Keep asking until they enter positive number

Please enter a positive number:
-5


Please enter a positive number:
-2


Please enter a positive number:
0



Please enter a positive number:
5



End of the program





Please enter a positive number:
5

End of the program




CONTROL STATEMENTS
break; // is used to completely break the loop
continue; // is used to skip one (current) iteration





HOW TO DECIDE BETWEEN FOR, WHILE and DO-WHILE

Do I know the exact number of iteration?

YES 				NO
for 				while or do-while

					Do I need to execute the block at least once?

					YES 			NO
					do-while        while






for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++){ // outer loop
	for(int j = 100; j <= 500; j++){ // inner loop
	
	}
}

10 times the outer loop is running
for each outer loop iteration, the inner loop will run 401 times

i = 1
	j = 100
	j = 101
	j = 102
	.
	.
	.
	.
	.
	j = 500
i = 2
	j = 100
	j = 101
	j = 102
	.
	.
	.
	.
	.
	j = 500
i = 3
	j = 100
	j = 101
	j = 102
	.
	.
	.
	.
	.
	j = 500


i = 10
	j = 100
	j = 101
	j = 102
	.
	.
	.
	.
	.
	j = 500
