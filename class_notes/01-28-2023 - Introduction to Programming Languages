Computer: 
-machine that takes input and respond with an output
-answers questions
-device that can communicate the other devices
-stores, retrieves and processes data
-calculates



Binary code: ones and zeros
-It is machine language
-Videos, texts, images, maps
-Counting system

one = ON
zero = OFF

CPU: Central Processing Unit



Counting System

Oldest way of counting -> | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

Binary -> 0, 1

1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024

Decimal System -> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 .... 9

10, 20, 30 .... 99

100, 200, 300, 999

1000, 2000, 9999


HUMAN WAY - Decimal 		Machine - BINARY WAY
0 							00000000
1 							00000001
2 							00000010
3 							00000011	
27 							00011011
65 							01000001

Java 	-> 

A -> 01000001
a -> 01100001


01000001 != 01100001



CAT
C = 67 	01000011		
A = 65 	01000001
T = 84  01010100

CAT -> 010000110100000101010100

Pen -> 

P = 80
e = 101
n = 110


00111000   -> What is this character?
56 -> digit 8


01011111
64 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 -> 95 
_ under score


{} 		-> curly braces
[] 		-> square brackets
() 		-> parantheses
<> 		-> diamond brackets
: 		-> colon
; 		-> semi-colon
, 		-> coma
. 		-> dot
! 		-> exclamation mark
& 		-> AND
| 		-> pipe
/       -> forward slash
\       -> back slash
^ 		-> carrat



PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
-A programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks.

-Set of rules


-Natural languages: English
	alphabet, words, sentences, grammar


-Programming languages: Java, C# 
	keywords (reserved)
	syntax: grammar of programming languages

NOTE: Programming languages lack ambiguity, conflict, confusion.


- Each programming language has different rules, keywords etc.
- Different languages for different purposes, tasks


How did you find your first job? -> Error

Statements = a line of code


SDLC -> Software Development Life Cycle

Problem or a need -> An IDEA - Client -> PO - Re

'TAILOR' -> sewing machine parts
Contruction worker 

Instagram, Facebook, Netflix, HBO
Gmail, Outlook
Amazon, EBay, Etsy
Banking mobile app - Zelle

Client
Chatting apps - translator apps

Requirements
Platform where people can sell or buy products.

return information
Username, password, email
10 payment methods
3 addresses
300 products - Date, product details, price


Design
UI/UX designer
Figma, Photoshop, Adobe, Paint


Developer - coding


Design, expected ----- Development actual
				 TESTER


If expected and actual are equal -> TESTER gives OKAY
Otherwise, TESTER reports an issue - bug - defect




JAVA 
-Object-oriented language
-Platform independent "Write once run everywhere" WORE
-Android apps
-Mostly for backend development
-Gaming like Maincraft

-EASY TO LEARN
-Compiler language: set of rules that you should follow
-Interpret language: flexible 

Architecture: JDK, JRE, JVM, JIT

JDK: Java Development Kit : full package
JDK = JRE + JVM + Development tools

JRE: Java Runtime Environment
JRE = JVM + libraries

JVM: Java Virtual Machine
JVM execute the code

JIT: Just In Time Compiler
Helps with compiling the code and making it faster


Execution 		execute
Compilation 	compile

System.out.println("Hello World!");

Source code = code that is written in any programming language

Byte code = compiled code

Binary code = ones znd zeros


PROCESS OF EXECUTION: source code -> JVM (byte code) -> binary code


compiler = converts source code into byte code
execution = running the code

javac -> will compile the code
java  -> will execute the code

OS: MacOS, Windows, Linux, Unix, IOS, Android


COMMENTS IN OUR CODE
     
        //Single-line comment
        
        /*
        Multi-line comments
        Hello....
        World.....
        My name
        TechGlobal
         */
